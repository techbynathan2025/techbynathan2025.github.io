       <p>There is a reason the dog is called Mans Best Freind. They are loving, caring and make you feel good when you are down. One of the best things about dogs is that they are very playful and will want to play with you whenever you want to play with there fun loving pet. For example, everyday I go outside to practice some soccer and he always joins in and makes it more fun for me and it is extra challenging so I can get better. Some may argue that a cat is easier to care for because it is smaller and doesn't need much care but, they require about the same amount unless you are counting playing with them, but who doesn't love playing with there dog. Overall dogs are great loving pets that care and will never let you down. This is why I prefer dogs over cats.</p>
